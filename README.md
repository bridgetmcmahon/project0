# Project 0 - Tic Tac Toe

## Why I did this
This game is a project for the immersive web development course I'm doing at General Assembly. The goal is to take what we've learned about HTML, CSS, Javascript & jQuery in the last two weeks and create a Tic Tac Toe game from scratch.

At the time of developing/writing this README, it is 1 week until Christmas, so it is festively themed - 'tis the season etc. I may remove this later, but Christmas is fun so I also might leave it.

## How I did this
I started by creating a game object containing all the necessary logic to play Tic Tac Toe using noughts & crosses.

Languages:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (and jQuery)

## Still to come
I attempted creating a computer AI that was reasonably hard (if not impossible) to beat. I tried implementing this using the min-max algorithm after reading a [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) article and [this article](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-make-your-tic-tac-toe-game-unbeatable-by-using-the-minimax-algorithm-9d690bad4b37) at Free Code Camp, but both my maths and coding skills failed me and I couldn't quite get it to work. Instead, the computer AI is simple and fills random positions on the board. The unbeatable AI is something I plan to come back to and solve.
