# Project 0 - Tic Tac Toe

## Why I did this
This game is a project for the immersive web development course I'm doing at General Assembly. The goal is to take what we've learned about HTML, CSS, Javascript & jQuery in the last two weeks and create a Tic Tac Toe game from scratch.

At the time of developing/writing this README, it is 1 week until Christmas, so it is festively themed - 'tis the season etc. I may remove this later, but Christmas is fun so I also might leave it.

## How I did this
I started by creating a game object containing all the necessary logic to play Tic Tac Toe using noughts & crosses. It was initially a very basic player v player version. I spent a while mapping out how the functions would work and I wrote a fair bit of code to get it functioning. After that the challenge was to refactor the functions to make them less repetitive. Once I was happy with the functionality I tackled a bit of CSS and added some animations to make it play smoothly, followed by creating a computer AI. Adding the computer into the logic was a frustrating process because I had to rewrite a bit of the existing code and make it mesh with what I already had. It now works reasonably well (but I'm sure it still has a few bugs).

Languages & Tools:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons)

## Features
- Win counter and new game button so you can play multiple games and keep track of scores
- Optional Christmas tokens and Christmas theme
- An easy AI to play against

## Still to come
I attempted creating a computer AI that was reasonably hard (if not impossible) to beat. I tried implementing this using the min-max algorithm after reading a [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) article and [this article](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-make-your-tic-tac-toe-game-unbeatable-by-using-the-minimax-algorithm-9d690bad4b37) at Free Code Camp, but both my maths and coding skills failed me and I couldn't quite get it to work. Instead, the computer AI is simple and fills random positions on the board. The unbeatable AI is something I plan to come back to and solve.
